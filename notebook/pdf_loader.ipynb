In natural language processing, importance is represented by \"soft\"\\nweights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings\\nacross a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size.\\nUnlike \"hard\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \"soft\" weights exist only in the\\nforward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention\\nmechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system, but a more recent design,\\nnamely the transformer, removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention\\nscheme.\\nInspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of\\nusing information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent\\ninformation contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access\\nto any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\\n1950s–\\n1960s\\nPsychology and biology of attention.

The diagram shows the attention forward pass calculating correlations of the word \"that\" with other words in\\n\"See that girl run.\" Given the right weights from training, the network should be able to identify \"girl\" as a highly\\ncorrelated word. Some things to note:\\nThis example focuses on the attention of a single word \"that\". In practice, the attention of each\\nword is calculated in parallel to speed up calculations. Simply changing the lowercase \"x\"\\nvector to the uppercase \"X\" matrix will yield the formula for this.\\nSoftmax scaling qWkT / √100 prevents a high variance in qWkT that would allow a single word\\nto excessively dominate the softmax resulting in attention to only one word, as a discrete hard\\nmax would do.\\nNotation: the commonly written row-wise softmax formula above assumes that vectors are\\nrows, which runs contrary to the standard math notation of column vectors. More correctly, we\\nshould take the transpose of the context vector and use the column-wise softmax, resulting in\\nthe more correct form\\n.\\nIn translating between languages, alignment is the process of matching words from the source sentence to words of the translated sentence. Networks that\\nperform verbatim translation without regard to word order would show the highest scores along the (dominant) diagonal of the matrix. The off-diagonal\\ndominance shows that the attention mechanism is more nuanced.\\nConsider an example of translating I love you to French. On the first pass through the decoder, 94% of the attention weight is on the first English word I, so the\\nnetwork offers the word je. On the second pass of the decoder, 88% of the attention weight is on the third English word you, so it offers t\\'. On the last pass, 95%\\nof the attention weight is on the second English word love, so it offers aime.\\nIn the I love you example, the second word love is aligned with the third word aime.

The softmax function is permutation equivariant in the sense that:\\nBy noting that the transpose of a permutation matrix is also its inverse, it follows that:\\nwhich shows that QKV attention is equivariant with respect to re-ordering the queries (rows of \\n); and invariant to re-ordering of the key-value pairs in \\n.\\nThese properties are inherited when applying linear transforms to the inputs and outputs of QKV attention blocks. For example, a simple self-attention function\\ndefined as:\\nis permutation equivariant with respect to re-ordering the rows of the input matrix \\n in a non-trivial way, because every row of the output is a function of all\\nthe rows of the input. Similar properties hold for multi-head attention, which is defined below.\\nWhen QKV attention is used as a building block for an autoregressive decoder, and when at training time all input and output matrices have  rows, a masked\\nattention variant is used:\\nwhere the mask, \\n is a strictly upper triangular matrix, with zeros on and below the diagonal and \\n in every element above the diagonal. The\\nsoftmax output, also in \\n is then lower triangular, with zeros in all elements above the diagonal. The masking ensures that for all \\n, row  of\\nthe attention output is independent of row  of any of the three input matrices.

This process involves training a statistical model using \\nlabeled data, meaning each piece of input data is provided with the correct output. \\nFor instance, if you want a model to identify cats in images, supervised learning \\nwould involve feeding it many images of cats (inputs) that are explicitly labeled \"cat\" \\n(outputs). \\nThe goal of supervised learning is for the trained model to accurately predict the \\noutput for new, unseen data. This requires the algorithm to effectively generalize \\nfrom the training examples, a quality measured by its generalization error. \\nSupervised learning is commonly used for tasks like classification (predicting a \\ncategory, e.g., spam or not spam) and regression (predicting a continuous value, \\ne.g., house prices). \\nSteps to follow \\nTo solve a given problem of supervised learning, the following steps must be \\nperformed: \\nAlgorithm choice \\nA wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available, each with its strengths \\nand weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that works best on all \\nsupervised learning problems . \\nThere are four major issues to consider in supervised learning: \\nBias–variance tradeoff  \\nA first issue is the tradeoff between bias and variance. Imagine that we have \\navailable several different, but equally good, training data sets. A learning algorithm \\nis biased for a particular input 𝑥\\n if, when trained on each of these data sets, it is \\nsystematically incorrect when predicting the correct output for 𝑥\\n. A learning \\nalgorithm has high variance for a particular input 𝑥\\n if it predicts different output \\nvalues when trained on different training sets. The prediction error of a learned \\nclassifier is related to the sum of the bias and the variance of the learning algorithm. \\nGenerally, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance. A learning algorithm with \\nlow bias must be \"flexible\" so that it can fit the data well. But if the learning algorithm \\nis too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high \\nvariance. A key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to \\nadjust this tradeoff between bias and variance (either automatically or by providing a \\nbias/variance parameter that the user can adjust).'),\n",

LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt\\nengineering.[3] These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies[4]\\ninherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they\\nare trained on.[5]\\nThey consist of billions to trillions of parameters and operate as general-purpose sequence models,\\ngenerating, summarizing, translating, and reasoning over text. LLMs represent a significant new\\ntechnology in their ability to generalize across tasks with minimal task-specific supervision, enabling\\ncapabilities like conversational agents, code generation, knowledge retrieval, and automated reasoning\\nthat previously required bespoke systems.[6]\\nLLMs evolved from earlier statistical and recurrent neural network approaches to language modeling.\\nThe transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, replaced recurrence with self-attention, allowing\\nefficient parallelization, longer context handling, and scalable training on unprecedented data volumes.[7]\\nThis innovation enabled models like GPT, BERT, and their successors, which demonstrated emergent\\nbehaviors at scale, such as few-shot learning and compositional reasoning.[8]\\nReinforcement learning, particularly policy gradient algorithms, has been adapted to fine-tune LLMs for\\ndesired behaviors beyond raw next-token prediction.[9] Reinforcement learning from human feedback\\n(RLHF) applies these methods to optimize a policy, the LLM's output distribution, against reward signals\\nderived from human or automated preference judgments.[10] This has been critical for aligning model\\noutputs with user expectations, improving factuality, reducing harmful responses, and enhancing task\\nperformance.\\nBenchmark evaluations for LLMs have evolved from narrow linguistic assessments toward\\ncomprehensive, multi-task evaluations measuring reasoning, factual accuracy, alignment, and\\nsafety.[11][12] Hill climbing, iteratively optimizing models against benchmarks, has emerged as a\\ndominant strategy, producing rapid incremental performance gains but raising concerns of overfitting to\\nbenchmarks rather than achieving genuine generalization or robust capability improvements.[13]\\nBefore the emergence of transformer-based models in 2017, some language models were considered large\\nrelative to the computational and data constraints of their time. In the early 1990s, IBM's statistical\\nmodels pioneered word alignment techniques for machine translation, laying the groundwork for corpus-\\nbased language modeling.

The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in\\nplanning.[78]\\nMultiple agents with memory can interact socially.[79]\\nLLMs are conventionally trained to generate an output without generating intermediate steps. As a result,\\ntheir performance tends to be subpar on complex questions requiring (at least in humans) intermediate\\nsteps of thought. Early research demonstrated that inserting intermediate \"scratchpad\" computations\\ncould improve performance on such tasks.[80] Later methods overcame this deficiency more\\nsystematically by breaking tasks into smaller steps for the LLM, either manually or automatically.\\nPrompt chaining was introduced in 2022.[81] In this method, a user manually breaks a complex problem\\ndown into several steps. In each step, the LLM receives as input a prompt telling it what to do and some\\nresults from preceding steps. The result from one step is then reused in a next step, until a final answer is\\nreached. The ability of an LLM to follow instructions means that even non-experts can write a successful\\ncollection of stepwise prompts given a few rounds of trial and error.[82][83]\\nA 2022 paper demonstrated a separate technique called chain-of-thought prompting, which makes the\\nLLM break the question down autonomously. An LLM is given some examples where the \"assistant\"\\nverbally breaks down the thought process before arriving at an answer. The LLM mimics these examples\\nand also tries to spend some time generating intermediate steps before providing the final answer. This\\nadditional step elicited by prompting improves the correctness of the LLM on relatively complex\\nquestions. On math word questions, a prompted model can exceed even fine-tuned GPT-3 with a\\nverifier.[84][85] Chain-of-thought can also be elicited by simply adding an instruction like \"Let\\'s think step\\nby step\" to the prompt, in order to encourage the LLM to proceed methodically instead of trying to\\ndirectly guess the answer.[86]\\nIn late 2024, a new approach to LLM development emerged with \"reasoning models\".[87] These are\\ntrained to generate step-by-step analysis before producing final answers, enabling better results on\\ncomplex tasks, for instance in mathematics, coding and logic.[88] OpenAI introduced this concept with\\ntheir o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in April 2025.

American linguist George Lakoff presented neural theory\\nof language (NTL)[136] as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and\\nunderstanding.

Alice went to visit her\\nfriend, ____\".[2]\\nDatasets are of varying quality and may contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable,\\nor otherwise of low-quality.[153]\\nLLMs\\' rapid improvement regularly renders benchmarks obsolete, with the models exceeding the\\nperformance of human annotators.[154] In addition, \"shortcut learning\" allows AIs to \"cheat\" on multiple-\\nchoice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording to guess the correct\\nresponses, without considering the specific question.[124][155]\\nSome datasets are adversarial, focusing on problems that confound LLMs. One example is the\\nTruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions that stump LLMs by\\nmimicking falsehoods to which they were exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer\\n\"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom\\nyou can\\'t teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.[156]\\nAnother example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of\\nproblems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect\\ncompletions were generated by sampling from a language model.

This bias is particularly evident when\\nresponding to English queries, where models may present Western interpretations of concepts from other\\ncultures, such as Eastern religious practices.[162]\\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes due to generalization, including those based on\\ngender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation.[163] When replacing human representatives,\\nthis can lead to outputs that homogenize, or generalize groups of people.[164][165]\\nLimitations and challenges\\nHallucinations\\nAlgorithmic bias\\nStereotyping'),\n",
